Program is written for automated file access and filename manipulation.
It is not a 'complete' program: at the time I described it as a 
software 'black box' (before I knew how to articulate the concept of
abstraction). It was used for accessing multiple files from a working directory
and deleting duplicates / cleaning up filenames. This enabled a relatively quick
local file structure of a large, chaotically-organized hard drive. 

It's nothing groundbreaking, but this little bit of spaghetti turned a 
months-long job into about a four-week project. It allowed me to be
more productive at work, and it emboldened my desire to learn more
about operating and file systems and programming in general.
