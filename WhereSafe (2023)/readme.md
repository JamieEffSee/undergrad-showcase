The WhereSafe is a physical product developed for the "mini-Capstone" (3rd year) project.

Abstract (In the context of discussing the third release version):

_The WhereSafe System consists of a wearable sensor device and an associated mobile application. It
is designed to provide real-time information and tracking to users in extreme conditions and
environments. Full sensor functionality has been implemented, allowing for a spectrum of
environmental parameters to be passed as real-time data from the Adafruit BME680 sensor to
the app through an ESP32 microcontroller. Database functionality incorporates both local storage
and Firebase services, authenticated by Google, to enhance data security and storage/access
features. Advanced user accessibility features have been introduced, such as environmental
threshold alert notifications and dark mode display. Multiple user experience test batteries have
allowed the development of clean information displays and intuitive app navigation. A prototype
of the physical device has been produced, enabling portable operation of the sensor/board unit
using a standard 9V battery for about four hours. This configuration provides an efficient solution
for individuals and teams that desire accurate and up-to-date information about their
surroundings._

The entire system was produced for less than $50. The report document has certain pages redacted to
