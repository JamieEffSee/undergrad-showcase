Some standout files from my first big foray into VBA.
I had not received formal training in coding at this point,
so I apologize for any redundancy or spaghetti :)

INVENTORY
This was used for tracking our (enormous) inventory when we were switching
over control systems. This remained in use for about a month as a dynamic
inventory tracker that was used as a data dump for when the new system
arrived.

BARRED LIST
The bar that operated at the community association needed to keep track of
the patrons that were barred and given warnings. The bartenders also needed
a way to have a fresh list without rewriting it every time. This document
represented an ongoing project of mine to streamline the system. It tracks
expiration dates, is very sortable, and produces various reports on the patron
activity, allowing for observations trends or for pulling specific statistics.
