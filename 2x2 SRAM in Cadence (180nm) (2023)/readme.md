One of my first forays into proper IC design, a 2x2 SRAM bank with attempts at wordline and
bitline control. Uses CMOSIS5 technology (180nm) in Cadence. 

While an admittedly sophomore venture, this was one of the standout course projects that both 
underscored my love for electronics design and allowed me the latitude to express it. It is 
also one of the few such major design projects that I am in fact allowed to show to people --
so please do excuse the inexperience evident in such assertions as "min size layout".
